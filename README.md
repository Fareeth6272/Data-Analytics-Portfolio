# Final Conclusion:
Focus on marketing and sales strategies on middle-aged male customers with a graduate degree in the European region, especially targeting those with a commute distance of 0-1 miles. This customer segment has shown the highest propensity to purchase bikes. Additionally, tailor marketing content to highlight convenience, fitness, and lifestyle benefits of owning a bike, as this demographic is more inclined to buy. Special offers or promotions can be created specifically for this group with a focus on regions within Europe to maximize the sales potential.
